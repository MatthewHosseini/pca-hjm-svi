An end-to-end workflow used in the accompanying code and figures, comprising of:
  (1) conversion of daily U.S Treasury par yields from Excel into an instantaneous forward surface,
  (2) a run of PCA on changes in forwards to obtain data-driven level/slope/ curvature factors,
  (3) a link for the PCA objects into a simple Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) model to simulate curve dynamics.
